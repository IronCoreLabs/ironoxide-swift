# Encrypted Todo List

This example shows an iOS app that allows a user to create and manage todo lists where the content of the list is fully encrypted. Todo list content is encrypted on save and decrypted when the user opens the list. This example is meant to be a simple demonstration of how to add the IronOxide Swift library to your application.

## Setup

+ Install `libironoxide` via Homebrew with `brew install IronCoreLabs/ironcore/ironoxide`.
+ Open the project `.xcodeproj` file to launch XCode. You can run the app on both the iOS simulator and on an actual device.
